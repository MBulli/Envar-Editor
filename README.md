Envar-Editor
============

Provides a more powerful way than the system dialog to configure environment variables on Windows.


You rarely have to edit environment variables on Windows. But when you have to, it is quite a hassle most of the time. The build-in windows dialog is just too small for longer variables like PATH.
This program - which was actually created to kill boredom - makes it more comfortable.
